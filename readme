Explanation for the code can be found as inline comments in the code.

In brief the code creates UDP sockets for the sender and reciever and they communicate using Stop-and-Wait algorithm as per the problem statement

System Requirements
Ubuntu 20.04
g++ version 9.4.0

Steps to compile the Code

1. Open a terminal in the same directory
2. Enter the following in terminal one by one

g++ -o receiver reciever.cpp
g++ -o sender.cpp

Steps to execute the Code

1. Network Delay can be added using "sudo tc qdisc add dev lo root netem delay <Delay in miliseconds>"
2. Open Two Different Terminals T1 and T2

In T1 enter
./sender <SenderPort> <ReceiverPort> <RetransmissionTimer(s)> <NoOfPacketsToBeSent> > sender.txt

In T2 enter
./receiver.c <ReceiverPort> <SenderPort> <PacketDropProbability> > receiver.txt

3. After sender.cpp has done executing manually terminate receiver.cpp by Ctrl + C (this will not affect receiver.txt) in T2

The sender.txt, receiver.txt attached are for 

sudo tc qdisc add dev lo root netem delay 1000
./sender 8080 8082 2 10 > sender.txt
./receiver 8082 8080 0.3 > receiver.txt
